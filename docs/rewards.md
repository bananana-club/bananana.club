### 🌟 Revenue Rewards as a VIB  
As a **VIB**, you don’t just earn from your stake, you also get a share of **all off-chain revenue**, ensuring **long-term rewards** as the brand continues to grow.  

This is just the beginning! If the project goes viral, **even a small stake could be worth thousands or more.** 🚀🔥  

### 💰 Possibilities of Wealth  

#### Example Calculation:  
Since **only 20% of the total revenue** is allocated for **revenue rewards**, we first take **20% of the total earnings** and then apply the **0.1% or 0.01% stake**.  

For example, if a project earns **$1,000,000**:  
- **20% allocated for revenue rewards** = **$200,000**  
- **0.1% stake earnings** = **$20,000**  
- **0.01% stake earnings** = **$2,000**  

### 🔢 How Much Could You Earn from Revenue?  
If you become one of the **top referrers** with **1,000 contributors**, you can **own a 0.1% stake** in the revenue-sharing pool. Below are examples from successful projects, showing potential earnings:
