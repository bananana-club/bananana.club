Bananana is live! This blog will serve as the central hub for community contributions. Contributors can showcase their work by adding blog posts here and linking them to their socials for proper credit. It's a great way to gain more visibility and recognition for your contributions.

If you are a contributor, follow the steps below to submit your work:

## How to Submit Your Contributions

### 1) Add Your Post to Your `/username` Directory  
Each contributor should create a blog post detailing their contributions. Your post should be added to your personal `/username` directory inside the `/blog` directory. If your user directory does not exist, you can create it.  

### 2) Use the Correct File Naming Format  
The title of your `.mdx` file should be the current date in the format: 
```
YYYY-MM-DD.mdx
```

### 3) Add Images to the `/img` Folder
If your contributions include visual elements such as UI/UX designs, graphics, or any media, you can upload them to the `/img` folder and reference them in your blog post.

### 4) Add Yourself to `authors.yml`
If you are creating a blog post, donâ€™t forget to add yourself to the `authors.yml` file so you are properly credited.

### 5) Follow Community Guidelines  
All blog posts and contributions will be **reviewed by the community** before being published.  

- Keep your post clean and professional  
- No spam links allowed  
- Only include links to your **socials**, **GitHub**, **Dribbble**, **Behance**, or any other platform focused on publishing work  

### 6) Push Your Blog Post to Our GitHub  
Once your blog post is ready, push it to our GitHub repository. Make sure your changes follow the directory and naming guidelines before submitting a pull request.
